# Facial-Landmarks-Detection
In this project, we will see how to find 468 facial landmarks easily using a library called mediapipe , extract the X and Y coordinates
so we can use them as we like. We will see how to do it on an images.
There are a lot of applications for this type of function. Here are some examples on the site:

 1.  Face swapping (explained in 8 steps) – Opencv with Python
 2.  Pig’s nose (Instagram face filter) – Opencv with Python
 3.  Face detection using Haar Cascades – OpenCV 3.4 with python 3 Tutorial 37
 4.  Press a key by blinking eyes – Gaze controlled keyboard with Python and Opencv p.8
 
I made this project to make using the library as easy as possible. 
For those wishing to see the official documentation on this part, you can look at this Face mesh Documentaion in detail.
